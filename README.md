#  Improving London Underground resilience to flooding risk

In the São Paulo DACAS meeting (June 2016), one case study on how to make the London underground network more resilient with respect to interrupted stations due to flood events was chosen. The main idea to tackle the problem would be used to suggest new bus lines between the nodes of the damaged network, as a “Uber”'-like (based on demand) service, optimising the total time of travel per passenger. In the Manchester DACAS meeting (September 2016), we started working deeper in this case study. We constructed a network model, in which stations and lines are represented by nodes and links, and used average path length to quantify the damage due to interrupted stations in the case of a flood event. Then a new link, based on the a distance criteria, can be suggested to cover up the interrupted station and keep its functionality.
